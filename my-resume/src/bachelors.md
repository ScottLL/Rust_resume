I completed my bachelors degree in both Statistics and Economics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. During my time there, I gained a strong foundation in data science concepts and programming languages, such as python, R and SQL. I was able to apply what I learned in various group projects and coursework. I also had the opportunity to participate in a research [project](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2019/student-gallery-1.html) about machine learning algorithm under the guidance of a professor [Sebastian Raschka](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~sraschka/), which gave me valuable experience working on a real-world problem.
